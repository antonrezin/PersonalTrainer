## 🏋️ Personal Trainer (React + Vite)

I started creating a new **Personal Trainer** app, which I had already developed before but with a different UI. This time, I am focusing on improving my **React skills** and enhancing the overall **user experience**.

This application is built with **React and Vite**, utilizing a **pre-existing database** and communicating via **REST API calls**.

Once completed, I will **deploy** the application, and it will be available for **review and demo**.
